## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Buying ESP8266
**Problem:** ESP8266 has insufficient memory.
**Solution:** Get ESP32 (not ESP8266).

### Mistake #2: Power-Only USB Cable
**Problem:** Cable charges but doesn't transfer data.
**Solution:** Test cable with phone first, or buy "data cable".

### Mistake #3: Buying Raspberry Pi
**Problem:** More expensive, needs SD card, complex setup.
**Solution:** ESP32 is better for Ghost Protocol.

### Mistake #4: Ordering from China without checking ship time
**Problem:** 2-4 week wait.
**Solution:** Pay extra for local/faster shipping if impatient.

### Mistake #5: Buying Accessories You Don't Need
**Problem:** Spent $50 on kit when only need $10 board.
**Solution:** Just buy ESP32 + cable. That's it!
